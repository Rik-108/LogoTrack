# LogoTrack
-First I selected an iPhone 14 pro frame

-Then I selected a picture and put in on the background

-I created an area for dropping the images in the Landing Page

-The drop box receives the Logo and searches for it in the database

-If found it shows the result

-If not it shows 'Your logo is unique'
